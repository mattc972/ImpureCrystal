Impure Crystal (name not final) is a Crystal Hack with many changes to the original game. Such changes include Running Shoes, Infinite TMs, Physical/Special Split, and many more.

Future Decisions that I'll probably forget about if I don't put them here:

Comet Punch -> Make Fighting
Rock Smash -> Rename to Brick Break
Thrash -> 120 Base Power
Outrage -> 120 Base Power
Leech Life -> 80 Power, 10 PP, replace with Absorb in learnsets before adding
Lovely Kiss -> Give more access to the move
Whirlpool -> Wild Charge (Also need to make Field Item)
Zen Headbutt -> Cross Poison (?)
Bulldoze?
Roost, or give Recover to certain Pokemon (?)
